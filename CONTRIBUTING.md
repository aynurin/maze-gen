Thank you for considering contributing! Contributors and any contributions are
always welcome. If you want to contribute, here are some of the ways to do it.
And if you know how you want to contribute, but it's not described here, please
reach out by filing a bug tagged with "contributing."

I need help with:

1. Creating sample maps and games in Unity.
1. Spreading the word.
1. Trying and adapting the build to Godot.
1. Fixing bugs.
1. Creating and translating docs (including getting started).
1. Getting your feedback on usage and features.
1. Hearing ideas on enhancements.

## Contributing code

I know this library doesn't follow the regular C# code style. I believe that
adding extra line breaks before the `{` is wasting screen space. The included
`.editorconfig` will format the code for you automatically, so please
auto-format your code in your editor before sending the PR.

My code coverage goal is >98%, and for PRs with less than 95% I will ask to add
tests.

Don't mark internal code as `public` and provide `///` comments for all public
code.

When submitting a pull request, please indicate what it does and why you are
submitting it. E.g., if you are fixing a bug, please link the bug. If there is
no bug, ideally just create a bug first. If it's a new feature, consider
updating docs or adding a new .md in the `./docs` describing the feature.
